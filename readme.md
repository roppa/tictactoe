#Tic-tac-toe

Ah, remember war games. This was a lunch time challenge at work. Lots of ways to solve it actually. Just uses console. We assume there is only two users "x" and "o". The matrix runs from 0 - 8, representing three rows going left to right.

```
tictactoe.choose("x", 0);
```

To reset, just:

```
tictactoe.newGame();
```
